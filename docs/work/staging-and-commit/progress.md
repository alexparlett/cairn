# Progress — staging-and-commit

Running log, newest first. Dismissed QA findings are logged here with their
reasons, per phase.

## 2026-10-07 — planned

Planned with `/feature-plan` on `feature/plan-staging-and-commit`. Seven evidence
records under `docs/research/staging-and-commit/`; the user locked L1-L21 over five
rounds, asking for mechanism detail on the patch engine, which became
`patch-mechanics-spike.md` (git 2.30.9 and 2.56.0 agree on every case). The brief
was split: stash and `.gitignore` go to a new packet 5b, `stash-and-ignore`.
Program O3 closed: no backup before a discard, as Fork.

Recon found, and the plan answers: `Confirmed` derives `Clone` and its
constructor is callable from any crate (R1); the runner already feeds stdin, so
no runner change is needed for `apply` or `commit -F -`; a status begun before a
write is drawn after it today (R4.4); a focused text field likely hides the
window's chords and held modifiers today (R7.1, C15 fails first).

Side effect, reported to the user at the time: the git-verbs recon agent's GPG
experiment reached the user's real `gpg-agent` through its socket, wrote two test
private keys into `~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d/` and restarted the agent twice; the
agent was refused removing them, and the user was given the commands. No further
GPG experiments were run.
