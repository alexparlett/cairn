# Progress — fork-alignment

Running log, newest first. Each phase's dismissed QA findings are logged here with their
reasons, for the final QA phase to audit.

## 2026-10-16 — planned

Planned with `/feature-plan`.

Evidence in `docs/research/ui-review/`:
- two first-hand Fork for Windows 2.23.2 surveys (light, then dark), at 1024×768 over the fixture
  in `fixture-recipe.md`;
- Cairn's window over the same fixture;
- Cairn's UI as built;
- the earlier Fork evidence graded;
- the Freya chrome APIs.

The user locked S1-S5 and L1-L9 (`brainstorm.md`). They rejected the recommendation once, on the
menu bar: they chose Fork's caption row over the OS frame.

The surveys also found a git-parity bug in the graph's order. It became packet 5c,
`history-topo-order`, which runs first.

The design docs were rewritten to this end state:
- `docs/design/ui.md`: the chrome, the deviations, the sidebar, Local Changes, Show Lost Commits,
  the palette and type;
- `history-graph.md`: columns, `HEAD`'s reach, the stash lane;
- `diff.md`: the detail pane, avatars, the diff bar.

The roadmap gained 5c-5h.
