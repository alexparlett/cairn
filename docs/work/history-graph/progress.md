## 2026-09-14 — packet planned

Filed from the design decisions locked the same day (`docs/design/cairn.md` D3,
D4). Recon was done directly against the linked gix 0.87.1 source rather than
published docs, and produced one finding that changed the plan: gix has no
`--topo-order` equivalent, so the lane assigner cannot assume child-before-parent
arrival. That became L3 and requirement R1.4, and it is the reason phase 01 opens
with a decision (O1) rather than with code.

No implementation has started.
